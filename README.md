# Blockchain and DeFi Interaction Project

This repository contains two main directories:

1. **onchain**: A Hardhat project for smart contract development and deployment.
2. **backend**: A NestJS project using ethers.js to interact with the blockchain for ERC-20 token operations and DeFi protocols like Uniswap.

Each directory has detailed setup and usage instructions in their respective `README.md` files. Follow these guides to install dependencies, set up environment variables, and run the applications.
